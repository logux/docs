# Core Concepts of Logux

Logux synchronizes action log between peer-to-peer nodes.

You can use Logux to connect clients with a server, clients with clients, servers with servers or for mesh-networks. There is no big difference between clients and server in Logux. So we will call them **nodes**.

```haskell
[Client 1] ⇆ [Client 2] ⇆ [Server A] ⇆ [Server B]
```

However, we created Logux for standard applications with multiple web and mobile clients and several servers. Next chapter read will show how core concepts work in the standard case.

Each node has **action** log (list of operations). When you want to change the application state, you add an action to the log. An action is a JSON object that describes what happened. Every action must have a `type` property.

```js
{ type: 'user/rename' userId: 386, name: 'New name' }
```

Action **log** is append-only. You can only add actions, but can’t change or delete them. However, you can compress log by cleaning old actions, which are not actual anymore.

```js
app.log.add(action, meta)
```

Each action in the log has own **meta** with:

* `meta.id`: unique action ID.
* `meta.time`: action creation time. It uses local client’s time and could be different on different clients.
* `meta.added`: counter independent for each node, to track what actions must be synchronized on next connection.
* `meta.reasons`: an array of the strings. Each string is a code of some “reason” why action is still actual. When application will remove all reasons, Logux will clean the action from the log.
* Logux Client and Logux Server add `meta.subprotocol` with version of application-level protocol.
* Applications could add own data to **meta**.

  ```js
  [action, {
    // Core meta
    id: '1553821137583 388:mgxhClZT:mAKgAtBF 0',
    time: 1553821137582,
    added: 56,
    reasons: ['user:388:lastName'],
    // Logux Server meta
    subprotocol: 10,
    channels: ['users/388']
  }]
  ```

Differences between action and meta:

* **Actions are immutable.** But you can change meta (except `meta.id`, `meta.added`, and `meta.time`).
* Logux synchronizes actions, but **only meta.id, meta.time, and meta.subprotocol will be synchronized** by default. Each Logux implementation decides what meta keys it will synchronize.

You can use any method to connect Logux nodes. Logux uses **WebSocket** only as default way. You can replace connection class to own implementation.

During the synchronization Logux **guarantee**:

* Each action will be synchronized **only once**.
* Actions will have **the same order** on each node.

Logux is based on the **Optimistic UI** idea. When a node creates action, it applies it immediately to own application state. In the background, Logux will synchronize this new action with other nodes.

When node synchronizes action to another node, the next node will apply the action and synchronize action to other nodes.

Logux is based on the **offline-first** idea. If the node is offline right now, new actions will wait for a connection in the node’s log. Offline is a standard mode for Logux application.
